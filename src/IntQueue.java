/**
 *  The {@code Queue} class represents a first-in-first-out (FIFO)
 *  queue of generic items.
 *  It supports the usual <em>enqueue</em> and <em>dequeue</em>
 *  operations, along with methods for peeking at the first item,
 *  testing if the queue is empty, and iterating through
 *  the items in FIFO order.
 *  <p>
 *  This implementation uses a singly linked list with a static nested class for
 *  linked-list nodes. See  for the version from the
 *  textbook that uses a non-static nested class.
 *  See for a version that uses a resizing array.
 *  The <em>enqueue</em>, <em>dequeue</em>, <em>peek</em>, <em>size</em>, and <em>is-empty</em>
 *  operations all take constant time in the worst case.
 *  <p>
 *  For additional documentation, see <a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/13stacks">Section 1.3</a> of
 *  <i>Algorithms, 4th Edition</i> by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
